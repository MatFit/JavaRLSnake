### Java Reinforcement Learning: Why I should've used Python 
This project started after seeing a YT vid on Super Mario Bro where Mario, who was made w/ a genetic algorithm of something, beat the game. I thought "dang thats cool" and decided to remake a simple Snake and try out RL (had to learn it along the way). Java being basically object-oriented I thought making the snake game was most appriopiate. I came acorss Java Swing to build the GUI (very very simple and minimalist like the original). Game logic was simple. 

But here is where I should've used Python. DeepLearning4whatever, as if RL on it's own had a learning curve, this was pain. Turns out using Python libraries like Pytorch, Keras, or TensorFlow would've made this much more easier. A lot of depreciated features, sifting through method calls when configurating the NN model, making an updateQ-Values and tweaking hyperparameters when updating Q-Val.
